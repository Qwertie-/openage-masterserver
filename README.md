openage matchmaking and lobbies
===============================

What's this?
------------

This is the "master server" for [openage](http://openage.sft.mx).

Features:

* [ ] Dedicated server registry for public lobbies
* [ ] Player accounts
* [ ] Match results signed with [GPG](https://www.gnupg.org/)
* [ ] Player and match statistics
* [ ] [Elo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) rankings and match making


When you want to play **with friends** via LAN, VPN or Internet,
this server is not required for you.

This server provides available public lobbies and can generate
balanced battles through Elo matchmaking.


How do I run this thing?
------------------------

You probably don't want to run it except for development:
To have one "official" community, this server is provided by sft.

Currently, no component is functional, but soonâ„¢ you may see progress.


Can I help?
-----------

Yay! You can just start hacking on whatever you like to improve.
Fix bugs, implement features, submit pull requests!
